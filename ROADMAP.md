# Roadmap

Current state: the stack builds, starts, indexes a mounted codebase into a
file/import graph, and serves that graph to Claude CLI over SSE. What follows is
deliberately deferred work, in the order it should be picked up.

## 1. Tree-sitter AST parsing [COMPLETED]

The `ctxgraph` package (`graphify/src/ctxgraph/`) uses tree-sitter for SH, MD,
MAKE, DOCKERFILE, HCL/TF, YAML, TOML. Programming languages moved to the
upstream graphifyy extractor, which covers more of them and tags every edge
with a confidence; the parsers for TS, TSX, JS, PY, GO, RS are kept as a
fallback but are no longer reached. The split is `GRAPHIFYY_EXTENSIONS` in
`config.py`.

- emits `function`, `method`, `class` and per-language entity nodes, scoped to
  their file as `path::name`
- emits `calls`, `inherits`, `imports` edges, resolved against the entities of
  the same language family in a second pass
- resolves relative import targets to file nodes, and everything else to
  `external_import` / `external_symbol` placeholders
- reads Ansible YAML by its values rather than its syntax: plays, tasks,
  handlers and role variables, plus `includes`, `uses_role`, `depends_on`,
  `reads_vars`, `uses_template`, `uses_file` and `notifies` edges

## 2. Embedding generation

`code_embeddings` exists with a `vector(1536)` column and an HNSW cosine index,
but nothing writes to it.

Open decision: a local model (`fastembed` or `sentence-transformers`, no key
needed, large image) versus an API provider (matches 1536 dimensions directly,
needs a key and network egress from the container). Whichever is chosen, chunk
on the AST node boundaries from step 1 rather than on fixed line windows.

## 3. Semantic search MCP tool

Once embeddings exist, add `search_code_semantic` to
`mcp-server/src/index.ts`, querying `embedding <=> $1` against the HNSW index
and returning the owning nodes. The tool is not worth adding before then, since
it would return nothing.

## 4. Incremental indexing [COMPLETED]

`make index` rewrites every node on every run. A re-index now clears what it
previously derived from each file it visits, but a file deleted from the tree is
never visited again and its nodes stay. Track file content hashes in
`graph_nodes.metadata` to skip unchanged files, and prune nodes whose file is
gone.

## 5. Use public registry for built images

User have to build images each time. Better way to pull images from some
public storage instead of.

## 6. Multi-projects support [COMPLETED]

One database holds every indexed codebase. `projects` names them, every other
table carries a `project` column, and `graph_nodes` is keyed on
`(project, id)`, since `README.md` is a node id in every codebase there is.

`make index PROJECT=/path/to/anything` indexes a tree under a name taken from
its last path segment, and needs nothing inside the target: no checkout of this
repository, no `.env`, no Makefile. A client binds to a project through the
address it connects to (`/mcp/<project>`), and every tool takes an optional
`project` to read a neighbour's graph from the same session. `list_projects`
says what is there.

Edges stay inside one project, which is not a limitation so much as a fact
about the producer: the indexer is handed a single tree and resolves every
target within it, so a cross-project edge has no way to be discovered. Giving
`graph_edges` a second project column would only add one that is always equal.
Relating two codebases needs a resolver that sees both, which is its own piece
of work.

## 7. Git hook for re-indexing

Implement git-hook for run re-indexing for each commit.

## 8. Use some CPU-Driven local model for generate summary

We use dump analyst, better to use some local model
just for this, for reduce token usage.

Model should be part of compose deployment.

## 9. Implement MCP support for Gemini [COMPLETED]

`.gemini/settings.json` registers both servers, and the skill in `skills/` is
registered for Claude and Gemini by `make skill-install`. The transport moved
from SSE to Streamable HTTP (`/mcp`) along the way; `/sse` is still served for
older clients.

## 10. Incremental extraction for the code half

The Tree-sitter parsers skip a file whose hash is unchanged. The graphifyy pass
does not: it re-extracts the whole code corpus on every run, because an
extraction over a subset loses the edges between the files left out. Its own
per-file cache absorbs most of the cost, but the merge into the database is
still full. Worth revisiting with `graphify.detect.detect_incremental` once the
graph is large enough for it to matter.
