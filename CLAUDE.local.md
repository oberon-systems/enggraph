## Research policy: graph before Read/Write

For any exploration in this repo - finding usages, tracing call chains, understanding
module relationships, answering "what calls this" / "how do these connect" - query the
code graph FIRST, before Read, Grep, or spawning agents that only grep/Read. Use the
`graphify` skill's `context` MCP tools (`search_code_nodes`, `get_code_graph_neighbors`,
`get_node_summary`, `shortest_path`) to locate and orient before opening files.

Fall back to Read/Grep only when the graph doesn't cover the question: the target isn't
indexed yet, the index predates the current tree (re-run `make index PROJECT=<path>`
first), or the question is about literal file content (comments, string literals, exact
line numbers) rather than structure.

If a node exists in the graph but has no summary, don't write the summary yourself -
delegate summary collection to `gemini-3.1-flash-lite` (same headless invocation as the
delegate section below), then once it reports back, persist that summary into the graph via
`context` MCP tools (`save_node_summary`) so the next lookup finds it there instead of
re-deriving it.

Do this check right after every Explore-agent run, not just incidentally: before moving on,
look at the nodes/files that agent touched, and for any still missing a summary, run the
delegate-and-save step above immediately rather than letting it slide.

This is the default research order for the whole repo - the "verify from the graph"
step in the Gemini delegate section below is one specific application of it, not the
only one. It governs _how_ to research when research is actually needed; it never
authorizes research that an existing plan has already done. An active plan in the graph
outranks exploration - see the plans section below.

## Plans always get persisted to the graph - full lifecycle

The plan-mode plan file (`/home/user/.claude-work/plans/*.md`) is session-local and
ephemeral - a different session/client can't see it. The graph is the shared source of
truth for plans across sessions.

**An active plan in the graph is an approved plan.** It carries `status: active` only
because the user already approved it via `ExitPlanMode`. Finding one is not an invitation
to re-check the work behind it - it is the instruction for what to do next. Execute it.

Four rules, all mandatory:

1. **Before anything else** on a non-trivial request - before any graph query, any Read,
   any Explore or Plan agent - call `get_plans` (project `puppet`, default
   `status: active`). This is the first tool call of the turn, not something to get to
   eventually.
2. **If an active plan covers the request, act on it.** Follow its steps in order. Do NOT:

   - spawn Explore or Plan agents to "get oriented" first;
   - re-run the research the plan already summarizes;
   - re-verify the plan's conclusions, restate them back for approval, or re-enter plan
     mode to produce the same plan again;
   - read files the current step does not touch.

   **Once a plan is loaded, the plan defines the file set, and NOTHING OUTSIDE IT MAY
   BE TOUCHED. No Read, no Write, no Edit, no Grep sweep, no Explore agent doing any of
   those on a file the plan does not name.** The permitted set is exactly two things:
   the files the current step names, and the nodes the graph returns for the entity
   that step changes. That is the whole of it. Wandering the tree "to be sure" is the
   behaviour this rule exists to stop - the plan already did that work, and redoing it
   is how a finished plan turns back into an open-ended exploration.

   If a step genuinely cannot be implemented without a file the plan never names, that
   is a defect in the plan, not a licence to go browsing: name the file, say why it is
   needed, amend that one step, and continue from there. Ask first, read after - never
   the other way round.

   The single escape hatch is staleness: if a specific step no longer matches the tree
   (the file, class or parameter it names is gone or renamed), verify **that one step**,
   say so to the user, adjust that step in place, and continue. A stale step is never a
   reason to discard the plan and re-plan from scratch.

3. **Whenever a plan is finalized** (approved via `ExitPlanMode`), immediately also save it
   with `save_plan` - same content, a stable `plan_id` derived from the topic,
   `status: active` - so any other/future client can pick it up via `get_plans`.
4. **After the plan's work is actually done** (implemented, verified, landed), retire it.
   There is no delete tool in the `context` MCP set, only `save_plan`/`get_plans`, so
   "delete" means calling `save_plan` again with the same `plan_id` and
   `status: completed` (or `archived`), which drops it out of `get_plans`' default
   `active` filter. Don't leave finished plans sitting as `active` - that's what makes
   rule 1 trustworthy for the next session instead of surfacing stale, already-done work.

## Recap: report how the work was actually done

Every time a task ends - implementation, review, research, anything that took more than
a single answer - close the reply with a **Recap** section stating how the answer was
produced, not just what it concluded. Counts, not adjectives. Four lines, in this order,
and skip a line only when its count is genuinely zero:

1. **Graph / `context` MCP** - total calls, broken down by tool and purpose:
   `get_plans` (the mandatory rule-1 check, and what it returned), `save_plan`
   (finalized / retired), `search_code_nodes` and `get_code_graph_neighbors` (what was
   being located), `get_node_summary`, `save_node_summary`, `clear_file_hash`,
   `list_indexed_files`. Say plainly when a lookup came back empty - that is the part
   that justifies the Read that followed.
2. **Direct `Read` / `Write` / `Edit`** - how many of each, on which files, **and why the
   graph was not enough**. The valid reasons are the ones the research policy above
   names: the question was about literal file content, the entity is not indexed, the
   index predates the tree, or the file was being written rather than researched. A Read
   with no reason given is a Read that should not have happened.
3. **Subagents** - one line each: name, model, what it was asked for, what it returned.
   Write "none" when none were spawned rather than omitting the line, since spawning one
   is a decision the user wants to see either way.
4. **External delegates** - the Gemini CLI runs: model, how many invocations, what the
   task file asked for, and how much of the result survived review. A delegate is not a
   subagent; keep the two counts separate and never merge them into one number.

The point is auditability of method: the user is comparing what the graph answered
against what was re-derived by hand, and cannot see the tool calls. So the recap is
written from what actually happened in the turn, never rounded, never reconstructed
from what the workflow says should have happened.

## Model routing across the workflow

- **Research/exploration** (Explore agents, graph queries, reading files to gather material
  for a plan) -> Sonnet 5 (`claude-sonnet-5`).
- **Writing the plan itself** (turning research into the actual implementation plan) -> Opus 5
  (`claude-opus-5`).
- **Implementation** -> handed to Gemini (`gemini-3.1-flash-lite`), per the delegate section below.
- **Verification of what Gemini wrote** -> the impact sweep runs on Sonnet 5, the verdict
  is Opus 5's. See the Gemini section below.

## Delegating Work to Gemini

Ordinary implementation work may be handed to the Gemini CLI on `gemini-3.1-flash-lite`:

- Start from a clean tree (`git status --short` empty), so that afterwards `git diff` is
  exactly what the delegate wrote.
- Run it headless, task in a file to avoid quoting problems:
  `gemini -m gemini-3.1-flash-lite --approval-mode yolo -p "$(cat task.txt)"`.
  `yolo` is required - a headless run has nobody to answer a prompt, and `auto_edit`
  stalls on the first shell command.

### Reviewing the delegate's work

Opus 5 reviews, and it reviews the **actual changes** - never the delegate's own summary,
which is a claim rather than a result. The review is driven by the graph, not by reading
the diff in isolation:

1. Take the real changes from `git diff`: the files, classes, defines, functions and
   parameters that actually moved.
2. For every changed entity, query the graph (`search_code_nodes`,
   `get_code_graph_neighbors`) for everything attached to it - callers, includes, hiera
   keys, templates - and check whether the change breaks any of them.
3. That impact sweep is exploration, so it runs on Sonnet 5 (Explore agents / graph
   queries). Sonnet gathers evidence; it does not rule.
4. The verdict - accept, fix on top, or revert - is Opus 5's alone, taken on the
   evidence gathered.
