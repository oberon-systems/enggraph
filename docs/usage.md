## Essential commands

```text
make init        create the virtualenv and install the pre-commit hooks
make install     onboard AGENT_ROOT=<path> onto the stack and register it
make lint        run every pre-commit hook over every file
make build       build every service image
make up          start postgres, mcp-server, the viewer and the dashboard
make down        stop the stack, keeping the database volume
context-install  onboard the tree you stand in; index it from the dashboard
context-project  onboard it as a project that reads no directory yet
context-source   add the directory you stand in to a project, under an alias
context-sources  list what every project reads
make mounts      rewrite the compose override from the projects table

make source-add  add PROJECT=<host path> to PROJECT_NAME= as ALIAS=
make source-drop stop PROJECT_NAME= reading ALIAS=
make summarize   describe PROJECT's files with the model (BG=1 detaches)
make backup      write the database, or one project, to a file
make restore     put a backup file back
make status      show whether the stack runs and whether anything uses it

```

Run `make` with no target for the full list, including per-service
subdivisions (`make graphify build`, `make mcp typecheck`).

`make status` prints the running services, the `/health` payload, and the
node count. Its `sessions` field is the count of connected MCP clients - a
healthy stack reporting `0` means the client never attached, a different
problem from the stack being down.

Example - find how two pieces of code are related:

```text
search_code_nodes(query: "SummaryStore")
shortest_path(source_id: "src/index.ts::handleRequest", target_id: "src/storage.py::SummaryStore")
```

Errors come back as a tool result with `isError` set, rather than tearing
down the client session.

## Project types and searching across them

Every project carries a type: `codebase` (the default), `docs` and `config`
for indexed trees, and `memory` for the built-in `_memory` project. It is set
by the type given at onboarding and stored once - a later run without
`TYPE=` keeps it rather than resetting it.

The type earns its place in `search_code_nodes`, which is the one read that
need not stop at a project:

```text
search_code_nodes(query: "retention", project: "*")
search_code_nodes(query: "retention", project_type: "docs")
```

The first searches every graph in the database, the second every project of
one kind. Each row names its project, and the limit is shared out between the
projects rather than spent on whichever sorts first, so six indexed codebases
answer with six projects' hits. A named `project` and a `project_type` cannot
be combined - one narrows what the other spans.

## Projects that read several directories

A project is a selection of host directories rather than one tree. One
directory is mounted whole at `/code/<project>` and its node ids are paths
relative to it, which is what every project onboarded before this was. Several
directories are mounted at `/code/<project>/<alias>`, and each alias becomes
the first segment of every node id that directory produced:

```text
list_projects()
search_code_nodes(query: "nginx.conf", project: "mono")
get_node_summary(node_id: "configs/prod/nginx.conf")
```

`list_projects` carries a `sources` field naming the alias and the host path
of each one, so a lookup knows which prefix to expect. A search matches the
node id as well as the name, so the alias is also how a search is narrowed to
one slice.

Both halves of the graph are built in one pass over every directory, so a call
from one slice resolves into a definition in another rather than becoming an
external placeholder.

## Memory

What an agent works out about a repository - a convention, a decision, why
something is the way it is - has nowhere to live in a tree it may only read.
`save_memory` writes it into `_memory`, a built-in project of type `memory`
created by the migration, holding records rather than files:

```text
save_memory(memory_id: "commit-style", title: "Commits go through cz",
            text: "...", about: "*", tags: ["git"])
get_memory(about: "api")
drop_memory(memory_id: "api/commit-style")
```

A memory is tagged with what it is about, the way a plan is - a project name,
or `"*"` for one belonging to no repository in particular - and reading one
scope always returns the global ones alongside it. Nothing indexes into
`_memory`: indexing refuses a project name starting with `_`, so a memory
is never pruned by a re-index the way a derived node is. It is also not a
plan: a memory is what stays true after the task, a plan is what to do next.

## Suggestions

The other half of a memory. A memory says what is true about a codebase; a
suggestion says what the tools could not tell you about it - a lookup that came
back empty, a summary too thin to answer from, a file type no parser reads.
`save_suggestion` writes it into `_suggestions`, a built-in project of type
`suggestions`, holding records the same way `_memory` does:

```text
save_suggestion(suggestion_id: "hcl-no-parser",
                title: "No parser reads *.hcl",
                detail: "...", kind: "no-parser", lever: "coverage")
get_suggestions(about: "zeta")
save_suggestion(suggestion_id: "hcl-no-parser", title: "...", detail: "...",
                status: "resolved", bump: false)
```

The `suggestion_id` is a stable slug derived from the gap, and that is the
whole mechanism: saving under one that exists is how the same gap is reported
again. The record keeps its `first_seen`, moves its `last_seen`, increments
`hits`, and keeps any `kind` or `lever` the call did not name. It also reopens
a suggestion that had been resolved, because a gap hit again is not a resolved
one. `bump: false` corrects the wording or the status without claiming a fresh
sighting, which is what retiring one looks like.

Three vocabularies, free text in the database and documented rather than
`CHECK`-enforced, like a plan's status:

- `kind` - `empty-lookup`, `missing-summary`, `thin-summary`, `not-indexed`,
  `no-parser`, `stale-index`, `missing-tool`.
- `lever` - what closing the gap buys: `tokens` when the answer was re-derived
  by hand, `coverage` when the graph does not describe it at all, `runtime`
  when it was answerable but slow.
- `status` - `open` (the default), `resolved`, `wontfix`.

Reads default to the open ones of the named scope plus the global ones, most
often hit first; `status: "*"` reads every status. `drop_suggestion` erases the
count a record accumulated, so it is for one written by mistake - a gap that
has since been closed is retired with `status: "resolved"` instead. Because
`_suggestions` is a project like any other, `search_code_nodes` with
`project_type: "suggestions"` finds them, and the dashboard lists them on its
own tab.

## Plans

A plan is not derived from a tree, so it is not owned by a project: every
plan is a node of the built-in `_plans` project, keyed on a `plan_id` unique
across the database, with `project` a free-text tag in the node's metadata
rather than a foreign key. Consequences worth knowing:

- A plan survives a project drop and `drop_project`, and can name a
  repository this database has never indexed.
- `get_plans` defaults to the connected project plus the global ones;
  `project: "*"` lists every project's plans at once.
- `save_plan` with `project: "*"` stores a plan that belongs to no project -
  the right home for a procedure run on demand rather than finished once.

`type` is a separate axis from `status`: `status` (`active`, `completed`,
`archived`) says where a plan stands, `type` (`plan`, `template`,
`procedure`) says what kind of record it is. `get_plans` defaults to
`type: "plan"`, so a reusable procedure never shows up mixed in with
pending work; ask for `type: "*"` to see everything. Re-saving a plan
without naming a `type` resets it to `plan`, the same way omitting `status`
resets it to `active` - `save_plan` writes a whole row, it does not patch
one.

## Web interface

`make up` serves a dashboard at <http://localhost:3000>, on the stack's one
entry point. It's the one service here that writes to the database on a
browser's behalf and it has no authentication of its own, so anything that
can reach the entry point can edit what it shows.

- **Projects** - what's indexed, where it came from, node/edge/file/plan
  counts, and how stale the index is. Three tabs: _Indexed_ for the trees,
  _Organizations_ for the projects that hold other projects, and _System_ for
  the built-in ones holding what an agent wrote. Searchable
  by name or path, sortable by every count and by freshness, with the type
  staged in place and applied only when the change is confirmed, a `When`
  column naming the schedule each project resolves to and a `Sel` column
  saying whether the last index run read its selection from here or from a
  file left in the tree. _New project_ registers one, with a host path or
  without: a project that reads nothing yet is the one other projects are
  moved into.
- **A project** - five tabs: _overview_ (node type breakdown, the directories
  it reads - added, dropped, moved to another project, detached into one of
  their own, or joined by a whole project moved in here - the members it holds
  when it is an organization, and the organizations holding it), _graph_ (the
  viewer's page, proxied so the frame shares this origin), _nodes_ (search
  and inspect one node's summary, metadata, neighbours and stored source),
  _files_ (file nodes with entity counts and hash status), _settings_ (when
  it is indexed, and what it indexes).
- **Plans** - every plan in the database, filterable by project, status,
  type or a text search; opens as rendered markdown and edits in place.
- **Suggestions** - the recorded gaps, most often hit first, filterable by
  the project they are about, status or kind. It triages rather than
  authors: the status, the wording and the vocabularies are editable, the
  hit count and the first sighting are not, and there is no way to create
  one here - a suggestion is written by the agent that hit the gap.
- **Settings** - what every project falls back to when neither it nor one of
  its directories has said otherwise: the indexing schedule, and the
  selection.

### Indexing on a schedule

A project is indexed by hand until something says otherwise, and what says
otherwise is a mode stored beside the selection, at the same three levels:

| Mode       | What it does                                                  |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `off`      | nothing runs on its own; the Index button is the only trigger |
| `periodic` | a run every N minutes                                         |
| `auto`     | a run when a file changes, throttled, and the timer as well   |

`auto` watches the mounted directories with inotify and starts a run once
they have been quiet for the throttle. The timer stays under it as a
fallback, because a watch can be blind and say nothing about it: a tree on a
network filesystem delivers no events at all, and a watch the host refuses
for want of `fs.inotify.max_user_watches` is one the container cannot raise.

A project reading several directories folds them into one decision, because
a run covers all of them: the most eager directory decides the mode, the
shortest interval of the directories asking to be indexed wins, and a
directory left `off` is not watched. That last one is the point of the level

- watch the slice being worked on, and leave the vendored slice that churns
  alone. The `When` column on the projects list shows the mode each project
  comes to, and the settings tab states the whole result above the fields.

Two runs of one project never overlap: an index run holds a row, and a second
start is refused while the first is going, whether it came from the schedule
or from the button.

Registering a project or a directory writes a row and mounts nothing: the
compose override is a file on the host and both services hold the mounts they
started with, so `make mounts` there is what finishes the job. The dashboard
says so in its own reply rather than leaving it to be discovered.

A drop reports what it will cost before it happens and asks the project name
to be typed as confirmation. Dropping a directory is not a drop of what it
indexed - those nodes go on the next index run, the same way a deleted file's
do.
