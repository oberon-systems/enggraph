# Remote summarization worker

Describes the files of an indexed project with a local model, for a
`claude-context-mcp` stack running on another machine. The worker needs no
checkout of the code it describes, no database access and no Docker: it claims
batches over HTTP, is handed the text and the prompt to run, and sends one
sentence per file back.

It exists because the stack summarizes on the CPU it was given - about 30
seconds a file at two threads - while a desktop GPU does the same work in
about one.

## What it needs

- Python 3.10 or newer.
- `llama-cpp-python`, built for your GPU (below). It is the only dependency;
  everything else is the standard library.
- The API's token, and a route to its port. Plain HTTP, so this belongs on a
  trusted LAN or a VPN.

## Install

### Windows, NVIDIA

Everything from a fresh checkout to a running worker. Copy the whole block,
change the last line's address, token and project, and paste it into
a shell in the repository root - cmd or PowerShell, both work:

```bat
cd worker
py -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt --extra-index-url https://abetlen.github.io/llama-cpp-python/whl/cu124
pip install nvidia-cuda-runtime-cu12 nvidia-cublas-cu12
py -c "import glob,os,shutil,sysconfig;p=sysconfig.get_paths()['purelib'];[shutil.copy(f,os.path.join(p,'llama_cpp','lib')) for f in glob.glob(os.path.join(p,'nvidia','*','bin','*.dll'))]"
py -c "import llama_cpp; print('llama_cpp ok')"
py -m ctxworker.download
py -m ctxworker --api http://192.168.1.10:3003 --token <token> --project alpha
```

If the seventh line printed `llama_cpp ok` and the last one started
reporting files, the setup is finished and the rest of this section is
background. If it stopped somewhere, Troubleshooting at the end names each
failure by its message.

What the two lines in the middle are for: the wheel carries `llama.dll` and
`ggml-cuda.dll` but not the CUDA runtime they link against
(`cudart64_12.dll`, `cublas64_12.dll`, `cublasLt64_12.dll`), and
`llama_cpp\lib\` is a directory its loader already searches. Installing a
CUDA 12.x Toolkit from <https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads> is the
other way to supply the same three DLLs - about 3 GB, needs a fresh shell,
and survives a reinstall of `llama-cpp-python`, which the copy does not.

The CUDA index on the fourth line matters just as much. Installing without
it gets the CPU build, the card sits idle, and nothing says so - check the
llama.cpp banner on startup and confirm the layer count next to
`assigned to device CUDA0` is not zero. Always `cu124`, regardless of the
version `nvidia-smi` reports: it is the only one of `abetlen`'s CUDA wheel
indexes that currently publishes Windows wheels for a recent
`llama-cpp-python` release - `cu121`, `cu122` and `cu123` only carry
Windows wheels for much older releases, and installing against one of them
falls back to compiling from source. CUDA is driver-backward-compatible, so
a `cu124` wheel runs fine on a driver that advertises an older version.

### Linux

```bash
cd worker
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt --extra-index-url https://abetlen.github.io/llama-cpp-python/whl/cu124
```

Without a GPU, drop the `--extra-index-url` and pass `--gpu-layers 0`. PyPI's
own `llama-cpp-python` ships no wheel, so a C/C++ toolchain has to be present
to build it - `sudo apt install build-essential` on Debian/Ubuntu, or the
equivalent for your distro.

## Get the weights

```text
py -m ctxworker.download                 # the default, qwen-1.5b
py -m ctxworker.download --model qwen-3b
py -m ctxworker.download --check         # where they would be, and whether they are
```

They land in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\context-mcp\models` on Windows and
`~/.local/share/context-mcp/models` elsewhere. The file is only moved into
place once it starts with the GGUF magic number, so an HTTP error page cannot
end up installed as a model.

`ctxworker/catalogue.py` is the list of models, and the stack's own
`make llm-model-install` reads the same file - one table, not two.

A 6 GB card runs `qwen-3b` comfortably at this context size; `qwen-7b` wants
more. `qwen-1.5b` is the default because it is what the stack downloads.

## Run it

```text
set WORKER_API_TOKEN=<the token from the stack's .env>
py -m ctxworker --api http://192.168.1.10:3003 --project alpha
```

That opens a job over every file of `alpha` that still has no model summary,
then claims, describes and reports until the job is drained.

Useful flags, all of which also read an environment variable:

| Flag           | Variable            | Default                 | What it is                           |
| -------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `--api`        | `WORKER_API_URL`    | `http://127.0.0.1:3003` | where the stack is                   |
| `--token`      | `WORKER_API_TOKEN`  | -                       | required                             |
| `--project`    | `WORKER_PROJECT`    | -                       | what to describe                     |
| `--job-id`     | -                   | -                       | join a job that is already open      |
| `--model`      | `WORKER_MODEL`      | `qwen-1.5b`             | which weights, by catalogue name     |
| `--model-path` | `WORKER_MODEL_PATH` | -                       | a GGUF file directly                 |
| `--batch`      | `WORKER_BATCH`      | 4                       | files per claim                      |
| `--gpu-layers` | `WORKER_GPU_LAYERS` | -1 (all)                | 0 to stay on the CPU                 |
| `--ctx`        | `WORKER_CTX`        | 8192                    | context window                       |
| `--worker-id`  | `WORKER_ID`         | host-pid                | what shows up in the job's file list |
| `--once`       | -                   | -                       | one batch, then stop                 |

Several workers may run against one job; each claim is exclusive.

## Stopping, and crashing

Ctrl-C finishes the file in hand, hands the rest of the batch straight back,
and exits. A second Ctrl-C drops it immediately.

If the machine dies instead, the batch it held simply expires - the stack
gives those files to whoever asks next, and no work is lost beyond the file
that was in flight. This is why a job is a lease queue and not a list.

## Troubleshooting

- **`pip install` downloads a `.tar.gz` instead of a `.whl`, then fails with
  a CMake/`nmake`/compiler error** - no prebuilt wheel matched your platform
  for the pinned version, so pip fell back to compiling the source
  distribution. On Windows that needs a full MSVC toolchain (Visual Studio
  Build Tools, "Desktop development with C++" workload) and a matching CUDA
  Toolkit, neither of which this setup requires otherwise. The fix is to
  keep the pin in `requirements.txt` on a release that actually publishes a
  `cu124`/`win_amd64` wheel - it does by default; if you changed the pin,
  change it back or pick another version confirmed present at
  <https://abetlen.github.io/llama-cpp-python/whl/cu124/llama-cpp-python/>.
- **`Failed to load shared library ... llama.dll`** - the message ends
  with "or one of its dependencies", and that is what it is: the CUDA
  runtime, not `llama.dll` itself. Run the two-line recipe in the Windows
  install section above (the two NVIDIA lines), or install a
  CUDA 12.x Toolkit, then check with `py -c "import llama_cpp"`.
  If instead `dir .venv\Lib\site-packages\llama_cpp\lib` shows no
  `llama.dll` at all - `libllama.so`, say - the installed wheel is for
  another platform, and the fix is to reinstall it from the `cu124` index.
  The worker prints whichever of the two applies when it starts.
- **`Could not open requirements file`** - the install commands above must
  be run from the `worker/` directory, not the repository root; `cd worker`
  first.
- **`--ctx N cannot hold M characters`** - the job was created to show the
  model more text than the context window fits. Raise `--ctx`, or create the
  job with a smaller `input_chars`.
- **401** - the token does not match the stack's `WORKER_API_TOKEN`.
- **A job that finishes instantly with everything skipped** - the project was
  indexed before file text was stored. Re-index it on the stack
  (`make reindex PROJECT=...`) and create the job again.
- **The GPU is idle** - the CPU wheel got installed. Reinstall with the CUDA
  index above.
