rem Describe a project, with the model on the llama-server started by
rem start-llama-server.bat. The stack's address and its token are yours to
rem pass; the project is optional, and naming none describes every one of them:
rem   start-worker.bat --api http://192.168.1.10:3003 --token abc --project alpha
rem WORKER_API_URL, WORKER_API_TOKEN and WORKER_PROJECT work instead.
