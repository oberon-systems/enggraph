"""Bridge between the graphifyy extractor and the graph stored in PostgreSQL.

graphifyy is used as a library, not as a command. Its CLI only installs a
skill; the pipeline the skill drives is a handful of functions over a networkx
graph, which is what makes it usable from here at all.

Two directions cross this module:

    extraction dict  ->  graph_nodes / graph_edges      (import_extraction)
    graph_nodes / graph_edges  ->  networkx.Graph       (db_to_graph)

The second one is what lets everything graphifyy builds on top of a graph -
its HTML view, its clustering, its own stdio MCP server - read our database
instead of the file it normally expects.
