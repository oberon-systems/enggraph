"""What the mount listing says, which is what the compose override becomes.

The listing is three columns because a project can read more than one
directory: the project names the mount, the alias names the directory inside
it, and the host path is what is bound there. `scripts/mounts.sh` reads it and
checks the paths, so what is pinned here is the shape and the ordering.
