"""Where one source reads its selection from, and what wins when several say.

The order is a file in the tree, then the directory row, then the project row,
then the global default, then the built-in selection. Both documents resolve
independently, because a tree may ship one file and not the other - and the
origin is reported alongside the spec, since it is what the dashboard shows
and what an index run records.
