# graphify runs to completion and exits, so `run --rm` rather than `up`.

# One database holds every indexed codebase, so the tree to walk is an argument

# which is what makes indexing a neighbour a one-liner. PROJECT_PATH from .env
# is the default, so a plain `make index` keeps meaning what it did.
#
# PROJECT_ROOT travels alongside the mount because the container only ever sees
# /project, and the projects table records where that came from.
#

# The skill is one file, and both agents read the same format. What it cannot
# know from here is where it is being installed, which decides three things:
#
#   AGENT_ROOT   where the agents look. Claude Code reads .claude/skills/ of
#                the project root, and this repository is not that root when
#                the skill is installed into another codebase.
#   MAKE_PREFIX  how that codebase reaches these targets. From inside this
#                repository a plain `make`; from anywhere else `make -C` here,
#                since the stack lives here and nothing of it is in the other
#                repository. A codebase reaching this through a proxy target
#                of its own passes that instead.
#   SKILL_ROOT   which tree the skill's own project is. Indexing is an
#                argument now, so the rebuild command has to name the tree it
#                belongs to, or it would re-index whatever .env points at.
#
# Which is why the skill is rendered rather than linked: the placeholders in
# the source carry all three, and the installed copy names commands that
# actually run where it is installed. Editing the source needs a reinstall.
