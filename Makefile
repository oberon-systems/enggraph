# Everything a codebase needs to be usable from an agent, in one pass: the
# `context` server registered for both agents, the skills installed, an
# instruction file, the .ctxkeep/.ctxignore pair generated from what the tree
# actually holds, the shell aliases, and the projects row the rest of the
# stack addresses the tree by.
#
# It reads AGENT_ROOT exactly as the skill targets below do, and their
# comment is where that variable is explained, so onboarding a neighbour is
# the same one variable. Nothing it writes replaces a file that exists, which
# is what makes a second run safe: it fills in whatever is missing and reports
# the rest as kept.
#
# TYPE= categorises the project for the cross-project search - codebase, docs
# or config - and is stored with the row; empty keeps whatever a project was
# registered as before. ALIASES=0 leaves the shell rc file alone; SHELL_RC=
# names a different one. PERMISSIONS=0 leaves ~/.claude/settings.json alone,
# at the price of a confirmation prompt on every call the agent makes.
# MAKE_PREFIX is how the onboarded codebase reaches these targets, substituted
# into the instruction file: a plain `make` from inside this repository, and
# `make -C` here from anywhere else, since the stack lives here and nothing of
# it is in the other repository. A codebase reaching this through a proxy
